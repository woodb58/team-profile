Object-Oriented Programming: Team Profile Generator

Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Because testing is key to making code maintainable, you’ll also write unit tests for each part of your code and ensure that it passes all of them.

## App details:

- When the user is prompted for their team members and their information then an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input
- When the user clicks on an email address in the HTML the users default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address
- When the user clicks on the GitHub username that GitHub profile opens in a new tab
- When the user starts the application they are prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
- When the user enters the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number they are presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team
- When the user select the engineer option they are prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu
- When the user select the intern option they are prompted to enter the intern’s name, ID, email, and school, and I am taken back to the menu
- When the user decide to finish building their team they exit the application, and the HTML is generated
